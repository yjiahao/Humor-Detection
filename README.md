# Humor Detection of text

## What I did

In this project, I tried to predict whether a given text is intended to be humourous or not. I experimented with machine learning models, deep learning models (LSTMs and RNNs), as well as attempted to finetune BERT. I managed to get the best accuracy of 94.0% with finetuning BERT.

Through this project, I solidified my knowledge on natural language processing techniques, PyTorch, and gained a greater understanding of LSTMs, RNNs as well as Transformer architecture.
I also learnt how to save my model on HuggingFace, as well as how to load it from HuggingFace.

## To run the project

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

You should be able to run the cells in all of the notebooks.

## To take this project further, I can:

1. Develop an API to call my models' predictions programmatically.
2. Experiment with other zero-shot LLMs to check if they perform better than my current models.
